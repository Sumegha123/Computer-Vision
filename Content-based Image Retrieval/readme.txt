The objective of this project was to gain an understanding of pattern recognition and content based image retrieval. This was done by focusing separately on colour and texture and a combination of both to gain a deeper understanding of their role on image retrieval. All the work in this project has been done by pixel wise manipulation and inbuilt OpenCV functions have been sparingly used in an attempt to understand building histograms, feature vector and various distance metrics.
