The aim of this project was to understand the very basics of image processing such as filtering, edge detection using pixel wise manipulation. All the work in this project has been done by pixel wise manipulation and inbuilt OpenCV functions have been sparingly used in an attempt to understand the very foundation of accessing, reading and writing an image. 

The following filters have been implemented on images and live video:
1. Greyscale
2. Gaussian blur
3. Sobel X and Y as separable filters
4. Gradient magnitude from from Sobel X and Y
5. Blurring and Quantization
6. Cartoonization
7. Negative
8. Mirroring
9. Splitting 
10. R/B/G filter
11. Red colour pop

	There are 3 videos:
	1. outcpp.avi - The file generated using opencv Videogenerator
	2. Project_1 - Screen recording of all the filters (as some filters are not captured in the opencv Videogenerator)
	3. Color_pop - Added the effect later hence not a part of the cumulative video

-- Instructions for extensions:
	Keypress:
	'l': blur and quantize, then enter levels for quantization
	'c': cartoonization, then enter levels for quantization and threshold
	'n': negative
	'f': mirror image
	'p': split the image
	'r': revert to original
	'd': then enter "red", "blue" or "green" to add filter
	'e': red color pop
-- I have also included all the images I tested out during the project under resources
