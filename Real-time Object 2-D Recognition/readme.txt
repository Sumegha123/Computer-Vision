The objective of this project was to build a real-time 2D object recognition model. The entire process was broken into several pieces, starting from thresholding an image, processing it, finding major areas, computing the feature vectors and storing them as a way of training the model. The final model is able to classify 15 objects in real time and also has the capability to detect unknown objects and gives the user the capability to train the model for the same.

All the work in this project has been attempted to be done from scratch from thresholding the image, processing, storing training data and object recognition. Inbuilt OpenCV functions have been sparingly used in an attempt to understand all the steps that go into object recognition.
